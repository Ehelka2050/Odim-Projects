            Summer On A Sheet Pan: Ratatouille Edition
        </h2>
        <p>
            Ratatouille isn’t just a Disney movie—but you already knew that, right? If you know the 
            movie, then, of course, you also know the luscious French Provençal dish that is that 
            adorable little mouse’s namesake. The French have a way with vegetables and there may 
            be no better example of that than ratatouille. This simple, silky stew of eggplant, 
            tomato, zucchini flavored with onions and garlic—and always lots of good olive oil—is 
            a delicately-seasoned celebration of summer’s most beloved vegetables. While ratatouille 
            is delicious served all on its own—it’s classically rich with oil, so it’s a rib-sticking
             vegetarian dinner as-is—we’ve added sausage to the mix to take this sheet pan dinner 
             recipe to new heights. <br>

            Sweet summer vegetables get a slow-roast—nearly a poach—in plenty of olive oil. 
            Ratatouille really is as simple as that. And while we love the classic version, 
            our easy sheet pan version is pretty killer, too. Plus, we’re adding sausages to 
            bulk it up—insurance against any complaints from the peanut gallery—and recommend 
            serving it over a bed of creamy polenta. Here’s everything you’ll need to make 
            this easy ratatouille recipe:
            <ul>
                <li>Onions</li>
                <li>Fresh garlic</li>
                <li>Yellow squash</li>
                <li>Zucchini</li>
                <li>Eggplant</li>
                <li>Cherry or grape tomatoes</li>
                <li>Olive oil</li>
                <li>Herbs! Fresh basil, fresh thyme</li>
                <li>
                    Your favorite sausage. This can really be sausage that you love! Turkey, 
                    chicken or beaf sausage. You could even use a veggie, like Beyond Meat or 
                    Field Roast. Just adjust the cook time if need be, according. to the package
                    directions.

            How to Make Ratatouille On A Sheet Pan
        </h2>
        <p>
            Stew on a sheet pan? Yep! You’ll need a rimmed baking sheet for sure. Not only is 
            there half a cup of olive oil in this recipe, the vegetables will release a fair 
            amount of moisture as the ratatouille bakes. Just bear in mind that things will 
            get a bit saucy—in the best way—when selecting your baking sheet. So, you’ve got 
            your rimmed baking tray. Now what?
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Chopping: Losts of it. But the good news is that once the zucchini, squash, eggplant
                    and onions are sliced, the real work of this ratalouille recipe is done.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Toss all of the vegetables with olive oil, salt, basil and thyme on that rimmed 
                    sheet pan.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Nestle the sausage into the vegetables.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bake! Bake for 40 minutes, unit the vegetables are meltingly tender And
                    the sausage are cooked.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Serve! We think this is particurlarly good served over creamy polenta, but 
                    you could just serve it as it is with big salad and some crusty bread.
