                <h3 id="man">A man who finds courage in a grilled meat </h3>
                <p>
                    In the midst of uncertainty and self-doubt, there was a man who sought 
                    solace in the simple act of grilling meat. As he stood before the open 
                    flames, his senses awakened by the sizzling sound and the aroma that 
                    filled the air, he found a source of comfort and inspiration. In the
                    dance of fire and smoke, he saw a reflection of his own resilience
                    and determination. As he carefully tended to the meat, flipping it
                    with precision and care, he realized that this act symbolized his 
                    ability to take control of his own life, to shape and transform it 
                    into something extraordinary. Each sear on the meat represented a 
                    moment of courage, a reminder that he could face any challenge that 
                    came his way. Through the process of grilling, he found a sanctuary 
                    where he could momentarily escape the complexities of the world and 
                    reconnect with his inner strength. With every bite of the perfectly 
                    cooked meat, he savored not only the flavors but also the courage it 
                    had instilled in him, emboldening him to face the trials of life with 
                    unwavering resolve. The grill became more than a cooking tool; it became 
                    a symbol of his resilience, reminding him that even in the face of adversity, 
                    he had the power to create something delicious and meaningful. And as he 
                    shared his grilled masterpieces with loved ones, he not only nourished 
                    their bodies but also their spirits, spreading a taste of courage and 
                    inspiration with every bite.

                <h3 id="embracing">Embracing Individuality: Breaking Stereotypes and Building Relationships</h3>

                    <h5>Introduction:</h5>
                    <p>
                        In a world brimming with diversity, it is crucial to recognize the uniqueness 
                        of every individual. Despite this, stereotypes often cloud our judgment, 
                        leading us to believe that all men are the same. Moreover, the rise of negative 
                        sentiments, such as the claim that "men are trash," fails to acknowledge the 
                        multifaceted nature of humanity. This essay explores the fallacy of 
                        generalizations, encourages us to drop preconceived notions, and emphasizes 
                        the importance of fostering genuine relationships based on understanding and 
                        respect. <br>
                    </p>

                    <h5>Breaking Free from Stereotypes:</h5>
                    <p> 
                        The man sitting next to you is not a mere reflection of the one sitting beside 
                        him. Each individual possesses distinct qualities, experiences, and perspectives 
                        that shape their identity. Stereotyping not only oversimplifies the complexity 
                        of human beings but also inhibits our ability to forge meaningful connections. 
                        By acknowledging and embracing the diversity within the male population, we 
                        open ourselves up to a rich tapestry of stories waiting to be shared. 
                    </p>
                    <h5>Rejecting the Notion of Men as Trash:</h5>
                    <p>
                        It is unfair and unjust to label an entire gender as "trash." Such generalizations 
                        overlook the vast array of positive qualities, strengths, and contributions that 
                        men bring to society. Painting all men with a single brushstroke not only 
                        perpetuates harmful stereotypes but also undermines the progress we seek in 
                        building a more inclusive world. By recognizing the value and inherent 
                        worth of every individual, we can foster an environment that promotes mutual 
                        respect, understanding, and cooperation. 
                    </p>
                    <h5>Women's Role in Challenging Stereotypes:</h5>
                     <p>   
                        Ironically, some women who claim that "men are trash" are also waiting at the 
                        doorstep of relationships to collect when they are done. This contradictory 
                        behavior highlights the need to reassess our own biases. By perpetuating 
                        negative narratives, women inadvertently reinforce the very stereotypes they 
                        hope to eradicate. It is essential to remember that generalizations only serve 
                        to divide us further, hindering the growth of healthy relationships built on 
                        trust and understanding. <br> 
                    </p>
                    <h5>Embracing Nuance and Individuality:</h5>
                     <p>   
                        To build genuine connections, we must reject the notion of homogeneity and embrace 
                        the beauty of individuality. Each person carries a unique set of dreams, desires, 
                        and struggles. By acknowledging and appreciating these differences, 
                        we create a space where empathy and compassion can flourish. Let us not 
                        reduce the complexity of human existence to oversimplified caricatures, 
                        but rather strive to understand and celebrate the multifaceted nature of 
                        every individual. <br>
                    </p>
                    <h5>Conclusion:</h5>
                    <p>   
                        The notion that all men are the same or inherently trash is a gross oversimplification 
                        that hinders our ability to establish meaningful connections and foster harmonious 
                        relationships. We must break free from stereotypes, reject negative generalizations, 
                        and acknowledge the individuality of every person. By embracing nuance, respecting 
                        diversity, and treating others with empathy and understanding, we pave the way for a 
                        more inclusive and harmonious society. Let us drop preconceived notions, shatter 
                        stereotypes, and build a future where genuine connections flourish, unburdened by prejudice. <br>

                <h3 id="deterioration">The Deterioration of Human Morals in Various Sectors of Life: The Influence of Trusting Science and Neglecting Religion</h3>
    

                <h5>Abstract:</h5>
                <p>
                    This report examines the erosion of human morals across different sectors of 
                    life and explores the potential role of trust in science and the neglect of 
                    religious values in contributing to this decline. The report delves into the 
                    societal consequences of this deterioration and highlights the importance of 
                    striking a balance between scientific progress and religious principles to foster 
                    a more ethical and values-driven society.
                </p>
                <ol>
                <li><h5>Introduction</h5></li>
                <p>
                    Morality serves as a foundational framework that guides human behavior 
                    and helps maintain a harmonious and just society. However, in recent times, 
                    there has been a growing concern regarding the deterioration of morals across 
                    various sectors of life. This report aims to analyze this phenomenon and shed 
                    light on how the emphasis on science and the diminishing significance of religious 
                    values may have contributed to this decline.
                </p>
                <li><h5>Deterioration of Morals in Various Sectors</h5></li>
                <h5>2.1. Ethical Issues in Science and Technology </h5>
                <p>
                    As science and technology advance, ethical challenges arise. 
                    The pursuit of scientific knowledge sometimes overshadows
                    ethical considerations, leading to issues such as unethical 
                    research practices, misuse of technology, and ethical dilemmas related
                    to topics like genetic engineering, artificial intelligence, and privacy 
                    concerns. The disregard for ethical boundaries can result in the erosion of moral 
                    values within the scientific community and society at large. <br>
                </p>
                <h5>2.2. Erosion of Moral Values in Politics and Governance </h5>
                <p>
                    Politics and governance play a crucial role in shaping society. However, political 
                    leaders and institutions have faced numerous ethical controversies, including 
                    corruption, abuse of power, and lack of transparency. The erosion of moral values 
                    in these spheres undermines trust in public institutions and fosters a culture of 
                    self-interest rather than serving the common good.
                </p>
                <h5>2.3. Moral Relativism and Cultural Shifts </h5>
                <p>
                    In a globalized and interconnected world, cultural values and moral norms have 
                    undergone significant shifts. Moral relativism, the belief that moral judgments 
                    are subjective and vary across cultures, has become more prevalent. This has led 
                    to a decline in universally shared moral values, making it challenging to establish 
                    ethical standards and create a cohesive moral fabric in society.
                </p>
                <h5>2.4. Consumerism and Commercialization of Morals </h5>
                The rise of consumerism has influenced societal values and shifted the focus 
                from intrinsic moral principles to materialistic pursuits. The relentless 
                pursuit of wealth, status, and instant gratification often comes at the 
                expense of core values such as compassion, empathy, and social responsibility. 
                The commercialization of morals can lead to a society that prioritizes 
                individualistic pursuits over collective well-being.

                <li><h5> The Role of Trusting Science and Neglecting Religion</h5></li>
                <h5>3.1. Trust in Science and the Secularization of Society </h5>
                <p>
                    The advancement of scientific knowledge has led to an increased emphasis on 
                    rationality, empiricism, and evidence-based decision-making. While this 
                    has undoubtedly brought numerous benefits, an overreliance on scientific 
                    solutions and a disregard for religious perspectives may have contributed to 
                    the erosion of moral values. The secularization of society has diminished the 
                    influence of religious teachings, which often provide moral guidance and foster 
                    a sense of community and shared values.
                </p>
                <h5>3.2. Neglecting Religion and the Loss of Moral Foundations </h5>
                   <p>
                    Religious traditions and teachings have historically played a vital role in 
                    shaping moral values and ethical behavior. They provide a moral compass, 
                    emphasizing principles such as compassion, justice, and integrity. Neglecting 
                    religious values in favor of a purely scientific worldview can result in a 
                    loss of moral foundations, leaving a void that may be filled by moral relativism, 
                    individualism, and utilitarianism.
                </p>
                <li><h5>Societal Consequences and the Path Forward</h5></li>
                <h5>4.1. Erosion of Trust and Social Cohesion </h5>
                <p>    
                    The deterioration of moral values has significant societal consequences. It leads to

                <h3 id="the">The Negative Impact of Technology on Society and Strategies to Mitigate its Effects</h3>
                  <ol>  
                    <li><h5>Introduction</h5></li>
                    <p>
                        Technology has undeniably revolutionized various aspects of human life, ranging 
                        from communication and education to healthcare and transportation. While 
                        technological advancements have brought numerous benefits, it is essential to 
                        acknowledge the negative impacts they can have on society. This report aims to 
                        shed light on the adverse effects of technology and propose strategies to 
                        counter them effectively. 
                    </p>

                    <li><h5>Negative Impacts of Technology on Society</h5></li>
                    <h5>2.1. Social Isolation and Reduced Interpersonal Connections </h5>
                    <p>
                        Technology, particularly social media and online communication platforms, has 
                        led to increased social isolation and a decline in face-to-face interactions. 
                        People are more inclined to interact virtually rather than engaging in 
                        meaningful, in-person conversations, resulting in a weakened sense of community 
                        and diminished social skills. 
                    </p>

                    <p>2.2. Mental Health Issues </h5>
                    <p>
                        The excessive use of technology, especially smartphones and social media, has 
                        been linked to various mental health problems, including anxiety, depression, 
                        and addiction. Constant exposure to curated online content, cyberbullying, and 
                        the pressure to maintain a perfect digital persona can significantly impact 
                        individuals' well-being. 
                    </p>

                    <h5>2.3. Job Displacement and Economic Inequality </h5>
                    <p>
                        Automation and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have the potential to 
                        replace human workers in various industries, leading to job losses and economic 
                        inequality. The displacement of traditional jobs by machines can create 
                        challenges in retraining the workforce and ensuring equitable access to 
                        employment opportunities.

                    <h5>2.4. Privacy and Data Security Concerns </h5>
                    <p>
                        The proliferation of technology has raised serious concerns about privacy and 
                        data security. Large-scale data breaches, surveillance programs, and the 
                        collection of personal information without consent pose significant risks to 
                        individuals' privacy rights, potentially leading to identity theft and other 
                        forms of cybercrime. 
                    </p>

                    <li><h5>Strategies to Counter the Negative Impacts of Technology</h5></li>
                    <h5>3.1. Digital Well-being Education </h5>
                    <p>
                        Promoting digital well-being education programs in schools, workplaces, and 
                        communities can increase awareness about the potential negative effects of 
                        technology. These programs should educate individuals about responsible 
                        technology usage, digital citizenship, and the importance of balancing screen 
                        time with real-life interactions. 
                    </p>

                    <h5>3.2. Enhancing Digital Literacy and Critical Thinking Skills </h5>
                    <p>
                        Investing in digital literacy programs can equip individuals with the necessary 
                        skills to navigate the digital landscape safely. Emphasizing critical thinking, 
                        media literacy, and fact-checking can help people discern reliable information 
                        from misinformation, reducing the spread of false narratives and promoting a 
                        more informed society. 
                    </p>

                    <h5>3.3. Regulating and Ethical Technological Development </h5>
                    <p>
                        Governments and policymakers play a crucial role in regulating the development and 
                        deployment of technology. Establishing robust privacy regulations, data protection 
                        laws, and ethical guidelines for emerging technologies like AI can safeguard 
                        individuals' rights and prevent the misuse of personal data. 
                    </p>

                    <h5>3.4. Promoting Human-Centered Design </h5>
                    <p>
                        Adopting a human-centered design approach in technology development prioritizes 
                        the well-being and needs of individuals. Considering the social and psychological 
                        impact of technology during the design process can help mitigate negative 
                        consequences and create user-friendly, inclusive solutions. 
                    </p>

                    <h5>3.5. Encouraging Digital Detox and Mindfulness Practices </h5>
                    <p>
                        Promoting periodic digital detoxes and mindfulness practices can help individuals 
                        develop healthier relationships with technology. Encouraging unplugged leisure 
                        activities, engaging in physical exercise, and fostering offline social 
                        interactions can contribute to overall well-being and reduce dependence on 
                        technology.
                    </p>

                    <li><h5>Conclusion</h5></li>
                    <p>
                        While technology has undoubtedly transformed society, it is essential to acknowledge 
                        and address its negative impacts. By implementing strategies such as digital 
                        well-being education, enhancing digital literacy, regulatory frameworks, 
                        human-centered design, and promoting mindful technology usage, society can 
                        mitigate the adverse effects and foster a more balanced relationship with 
                        technology. Striking a careful balance between technological advancements and 
                        human well-being is crucial for a sustainable and thriving society in the 
                        digital age.

                 <p>   
                    In the depths of self-discovery, I journeyed wide, <br>
                    Seeking to uncover the man hidden inside, <br>
                    With courage as my compass, I ventured through, <br>
                    To find the essence of strength and wisdom too. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through trials and tribulations, I carved my way, <br>
                    Embracing vulnerability, shedding masks each day, <br>
                    For the man in me yearned to break free, <br>
                    To embody authenticity, my truest decree. <br>
                </p>
                <p> 
                    In the mirror's gaze, I met my own eyes, <br> 
                    Determined to unveil the man who lies, <br>
                    Beneath the layers of societal demands, <br>
                    To reclaim my essence with unwavering hands. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I sought the man in me, not defined by strife, <br>
                    But by compassion, empathy, and a balanced life, <br>
                    For masculinity's grace lies in its tender embrace, <br>
                    Honoring emotions, love, and heartfelt grace. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I dove into the depths of my own soul, <br>
                    Unraveling shadows, making myself whole, <br>
                    Discovering strengths I never knew I had, <br>
                    Unveiling the man, no longer shackled or sad. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    With each step forward, I shed old skin, <br>
                    Embracing growth, learning from within, <br>
                    The man in me blossomed, a flower in bloom, <br>
                    Nurturing compassion, dispelling the gloom. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I embraced my vulnerability, unafraid to feel, <br>
                    In tune with emotions, both raw and real, <br>
                    For a man's strength lies not in stoic might, <br>
                    But in the courage to show vulnerability's light. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I found resilience, the warrior within, <br>
                    Facing adversity with a fierce and steady grin, <br>
                    The man in me stood tall, unyielding and strong, <br>
                    A beacon of hope when things went wrong. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In nurturing relationships, I learned to give, <br>
                    To hold space, support, and help others live, <br>
                    For the man in me understood the power, <br>
                    Of love's embrace, in every fleeting hour. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I discovered the wisdom that comes with age, <br>
                    A timeless knowledge, written on life's page, <br>
                    For the man in me honored the lessons learned, <br>
                    From mistakes made and bridges burned. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I recognized the man in me as a protector, <br>
                    An advocate for justice, a voice to foster, <br>
                    For equality and respect, a foundation to lay, <br>
                    Creating a world where all voices have sway. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In embracing the man within, I found harmony, <br>
                    A fusion of masculine and feminine energy, <br>
                    For true strength lies in embracing the whole, <br>
                    Honoring the balance within my soul. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    So here I stand, a man through and through, <br>
                    Embracing my essence, steadfast and true, <br>
                    In self-discovery's embrace, I've come to see, <br>
                    The beauty that lies within the man in me. <br>

                </p>
                <p>
                    And as she embarks on this journey anew, <br>
                    She's not alone, for her support is true, <br>
                    Family and friends, with love as their guide, <br>
                    Encourage her heart, to never hide. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    They remind her of the strength she possesses, <br>
                    To embrace vulnerability, heal the distress, <br>
                    To find a love that mirrors her worth, <br>
                    A love that will nourish and give birth, <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    To a future bright, where fears dissolve, <br>
                    And the beauty of love's embrace evolves, <br>
                    Where she can build a family, strong and whole, <br>
                    With love as the foundation, a radiant soul. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    So let her shed the shackles of the past, <br>
                    Embrace the future, where dreams amass, <br>
                    For she is a girl of courage and grace, <br>
                    Ready to embrace love's sweet embrace. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    With patience and faith, she'll find her way, <br>
                    To a love that will mend the doubts that sway, <br>

                <h3 id="n">The fatherless son</h3>
                <p>
                    In the shadows of absence, a son stands,<br>
                    Bound by the weight of unseen hands, <br>
                    A father's touch, a distant dream, <br>
                    Lost in the void, a silent scream. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    No guiding voice to shape his way, <br>
                    No hand to lead him, day by day, <br>
                    He treads a path of uncertainty, <br>
                    In search of answers, his heart's plea. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the mirror's gaze, he sees a reflection, <br>
                    A father's absence, a poignant infection, <br>
                    Yearning for guidance, for a steady hand, <br>
                    To navigate the world's treacherous land. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    But in the absence, strength takes root, <br>
                    A resilience born from trials acute, <br>
                    He learns to rise, to persevere, <br>
                    To face the world, devoid of fear. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    With every challenge that comes his way, <br>
                    He summons courage, come what may, <br>
                    For within his heart, a fire burns, <br>
                    A testament to the lesson he learns. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    He finds solace in the love that remains,  <br>
                    In the mother's embrace, where comfort sustains, <br>
                    She becomes both compass and guide, <br>
                    Nurturing his spirit, side by side. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through the void, a village forms, <br>
                    A chorus of support, where love transforms, <br>
                    Uncles, mentors, and friends impart, <br>
                    Wisdom and guidance, filling the fatherless part. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    He learns from the stories of men, <br>
                    Who lend their strength time and again, <br>
                    Lessons passed from one generation to next, <br>
                    Filling the void with a resilient text. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    He molds his character, his own design, <br>
                    For his father's absence does not define, <br>
                    The man he becomes, the soul within, <br>
                    He forges his own path, unyielding and keen. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through trials and tribulations, he learns, <br>
                    To be self-reliant, to bridge the yearns, <br>
                    To nurture the wounds that lie unseen, <br>
                    Embracing vulnerability, a strength serene. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    For in the absence, a gift lies, <br>
                    A spirit forged in relentless ties, <br>
                    A son unbroken, unbowed, and strong, <br>
                    A testament to resilience all along. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    And when he looks upon his own kin, <br>
                    He vows to break the cycle, to truly begin, <br>
                    To be the father he longed for, so dear, <br>
                    Guiding his own with love sincere. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    For he knows the power he holds within, <br>
                    To rewrite the story, to let healing begin, <br>
                    A fatherless son no more, but a father himself, <br>
                    Nurturing love, embodying strength and wealth. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    And as he embraces his own child's hand, <br>
                    He breaks the cycle, forever grand, <br>
                    A legacy woven from past to present, <br>
                    A father's love, ever resplendent. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the tapestry of life, he finds his place, <br>
                    Embracing the journey, with grace and grace, <br>
                    For in his heart, a father's love resides, <br>
                    Eternal, unbroken, where love abides. <br>

                <h3 id="w">War</h3>

                In lands afar, where shadows loom, <br>
                A haunting tale of gloom and doom, <br>
                Where drums of war beat loud and strong, <br>
                And innocence is swallowed by the throng. <br>
                <br>
                Once peaceful valleys now stained with red, <br>
                Where countless souls, both living and dead, <br>
                Engage in a dance of fear and despair, <br>
                In the theater of battle, where hope is rare. <br>
                <br>
                Flags unfurled, symbols of strife, <br>
                In the name of power, they claim a life, <br>
                Brother against brother, sister against sister, <br>
                A tragic tableau, where love should persist. <br>
                <br>
                The clamor of weapons pierces the air, <br>
                Echoing cries of anguish and despair, <br>
                Families torn apart, dreams shattered, <br>
                As war's insidious web is woven and scattered. <br>
                <br>
                The soil drinks the blood of the fallen, <br>
                As sorrow's veil descends upon the fallen, <br>
                Mothers weep for sons they'll never hold, <br>
                And fathers mourn the stories left untold. <br>
                <br>
                In trenches deep, soldiers stand as one, <br>
                Bound by duty, their courage not undone, <br>
                They march through the fire, undeterred, <br>
                With hearts ablaze, their valor is heard. <br>
                <br>
                Yet in their eyes, a flicker of pain, <br>
                For they too yearn for peace to regain, <br>
                The weight of war upon their weary souls, <br>
                A burden too heavy for them to control. <br>
                <br>
                Generations pass, and still, wars persist, <br>
                Fueled by hatred, vengeance, and a twisted twist, <br>
                In pursuit of power, dominance, and greed, <br>
                Humanity's wounds, unable to be freed. <br>
                <br>
                But let us not forget the cost of war, <br>
                The lives shattered, the dreams no more, <br>
                In the midst of conflict, let compassion shine, <br>
                For it is through love that we truly define. <br>
                <br>
                Seek not the path of violence and disdain, <br>
                Instead, let empathy's embrace remain, <br>
                Build bridges of understanding and grace, <br>
                And mend the fractures that divide our race. <br>
                <br>
                For war is not the answer we seek, <br>
                A cycle of destruction, vicious and bleak, <br>
                Let peace be our banner, compassion our sword, <br>
                And in unity, let harmony be restored. <br>
                <br>
                So let us strive for a world anew, <br>
                Where swords are sheathed, and hearts break through, <br>
                A world where differences are embraced, <br>
                And the beauty of diversity is truly traced. <br>
                <br>
                In this endeavor, we shall endure, <br>
                Writing a story of peace, forever pure, <br>
                For the pen is mightier than the sword, <br>
                And love shall be the ultimate reward. <br>

                    One alternative to  fragmentation is of course Union under a banner a collective
                    ideal cause or purpose. The problem with uniting under a banner as the postmodernist who push
                    identity politics rightly point out is that to value something means simultaneously
                    to devalue other things, thus to value is an exclusionary process but the alternative 
                    is valueless no sequela to nihilism. A nihilism does not produce freedom exclusion
                    it just makes everyone excluded and that's an introlerable state directionless uncertain 
                    chaotic and angst-ridden when such uncertainty whict critical level. The counter response appears
                    first unconscious and the collectively expressed demand for a leader possessed by the spirit of 
                    totalitarian certainty who promises above all to restore order that society without a 
                    unifying principle oscillates unmoored between nihilism and totalitarianism human
                    beings have been wrestling with this problem since the beginning of civilization when
                    our capacity ot form large groups for all its advantages also started to pose a new threat
                    that of the hyper domination of the state collective or purpose but without the state
                    there's just fragmentation into smaller groups. The group itself cannot be done 
                    away with because for better or worse human beings are social animals not loners
                    like sharks or tigers. We are team players but being on one means not being others 
                    this means that any given team sidelines, marginalizes and alienates those who cannot
                    play game as conflicting with other teams.

                    traced back through Egypt to Mesopotamia before disappearing into unwritten history is
                    is that of the divine individual. This eons old work of the imagination is dramatic presentation
                    of an emergent idea which is the solution to how to organize social being without falling 
                    prey to nihilistic divisive Nisour deceitful totalitarian certainty. The group must untied
                    but under the banner of the individual. The indivedual is the source of the new wisdom that 
                    updates the antiquated nihilistic or totalitarian detretiss and glory of the past for 
                    better or worse that idea reaches its Apogee and christianity.

                    The divine individual is masculine the because the feminine is not individual.
                    The divide feminine is Instead mother and child however it is a hallmark of christian 
                    supposition that the redemption of both men and women comes through the masculine and 
                    that is because the masculine is the individual.
                    The central realization express dramatically and symbolically is that the subordination of 
                    the group to the ideal of the divine individual is the answer to the paradox of nihilism and 
                    totalitarianism. The divine individual is the man that every man admires and the man
                    who all women want their men to be, the divine individual is the idea from which diviations 
                    are punished by the group with contempt and disgrace and fidelity to which is rewarded by 
                    the group with attention and honor, the divine individual is not the winner of any individual game 
                    but the player who plays fairly and is therefore continually invited to play, the divine individual is
                    the builder, maintainer and expander of the state, he who boldly goes where no man has 
                    gone before and someone who eternally watches over the widows and the children. 
                    His power of direct and honest communication is that whict identifies, discusses and then
                    resolves that continually emergent problems of human existence. Identification with these images his belief.
                    In the belief is not the statement of agreement with a set of facts but the willingness
                    to act something out, To become something to stake your life on something for men and women alike, this
                    means voluntary adoption of responsibility for oneself, family and state. It's in that resposibility 
                    and not in rights but meaning itself resides. The meaning that makes life bearable.

            <h3>Why Men Aren’t Doing Well in the Modern World</h3>
            <div >
                <p>
                    Well i will tell you a couple of strange things that 
                    i don't really understand.
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                The first is when we have done the analysis of the 
                                effects of the future authoring program it has had a differential
                                impact on men and it's had a particularly differential impact on what I would
                                call excluded men and so that would be non-western ethnic minority men or majority men 
                                who aren't doing very.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So for example at Mohawk College the future autoring program had a particularly robust effect on 
                                Mohawk College student who were men who hadn't done very well in high school and hadn't 
                                picked a major that had a career destination at its end, so you can imagine those 
                                people are they have an ambiguous relationship with the idea of education and they are not 
                                oriented specifically toward a goal. They are not very motivated, Now why did it have a 
                                differential effect on men, That is a good question.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                The second: well women are doing better so it might just be a matter of the fact  
                                that it does better for people who aren't doing as well and at the moment most of them
                                are men. I don't believe I think that might be part of it but I don't believe that's all
                                of it, I think that part of the reason that women are doing better is because they are agreeable
                                and so if a system sets out a structure and says here is pathway to attainment, the women won't rebel
                                against that they will go along with it and that is working very well for them  at the moment.
                                The men especially the men on the disagreeable end of the distribution and there is way more men 
                                on the disagreeable of the distribution than there are women, Right! that is what you look at overlapping
                                normal distributions. The normal distributions female distribution for agreeableness is less male 
                                distribution for agreeableness tremendous overlap. it is okay women are higher all the really agreeable people 
                                are women and all the disagreeable people are men and maybe the real differences occurs at the extremes.
                                Right! so it is a very interesting side effect of overlapping distributions so they (people) can be
                                mostly the same but that can still produce radical differences. Disagreeable men won't do anything they 
                                don't want to do, they just say "up yours i will go home and play video games and i will do my own thing, i don't 
                                think I'm motivated" and so then if you take the men who are like that and you say okay what do yu want?,
                                you can have what you want but you bave to figure out what it is so?, they write down what they want.
                                That is what it looks like to me, now you know that is weak evidence but I'm trying to stretch out 
                                my understanding account for this but I will tell you something else that is really weird i don't understand
                                this either, more than 90% of the people who watch my videos on youtube are men, now that is weird because
                                about 80% of pychology students are women so that is not what you would expect right! you would expect that the 
                                majority of them would be women and you might say well it is because of the political stance. I have taken 
                                and I thought well that is possible, so i went and looked at the demographic data because I have that well
                                before I did any of the political videos 85% of my viewers were men so it is actually increased by six percent 
                                and that is not trivial but it was still overwhelmingly meant. So that was interesting I thought what the hell
                                why is that exactly and then now I have been watching crowds when I have been talking to them and the crowd that 
                                have come to see me in person. This happened at the University of Toroto free speech debate and I actually noticed it commented 
                                on it before the debate took place because I was talking about intrinsic differences between 
                                men and women. I looked around the room and I thought 80% of the people this room are men so I had all the women stand up
                                and then all the men stand up I said look like here is a natural experiment for some reason 80% of people who showed up are 
                                men now, everybody thought I was kind of cracked.
